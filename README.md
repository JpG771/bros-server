# bros-server
Bros Server for API calls.

Server for a personnal project to learn <b>Nodejs</b>, CRUD API calls and <b>PostgreSQL</b>.

## Next step
- Could use promise or async for postgres query [Postgres Doc](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries)
- Use Sequelize to abstract direct SQL query and change DB type by with a single string! [Sequelize website](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)
- Another option is to use [massive-js](https://github.com/dmfay/massive-js).
- Add [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for build logic.
